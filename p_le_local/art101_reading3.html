      <h4 class="font-italic" style="color: darkslategrey; text-align:left">Q1. From the Manovich reading, give 2 examples of user interface with a piece of technology that has a performative action or theatrical behavior. This is in context with the ideas credited to Brenda Laurel that Lev mentions in the article. They can be electronic/digital or analog but NOT a computer, video game console or smart phone. Explain why these are good examples.</h4>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Japanese toilet: Every designs aspect is designed with the focus of the good experience for people who use the toilet. The lid is auto opening and closing; the jet nozzle provide hand free aftercare so that the user doesn't need to worry about doing it themselves. In a nutshell, the toilet is designed to give the user a peace of mind when they are using the toilet.</p>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Smart house: One of many example that demonstrate the gamification of this technology is the auto-light that turns on or off with motion detection (hands, walking in/out of the room) or clapping.</p>

      <h4 class="font-italic" style="color: darkslategrey; text-align:left">Q2. Also from the Manovich reading, Lev uses the term Gesamtkunstwerk. What does this term mean and how is he referring to the aestheticization of information tools?</h4>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Gesamtkunstwerk refers to an act of engaging the senses, such as sight, hearing, touch, taste. Manovich states that the aestheticization of information tools is the shift from focusing on goods and service to user's experience.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-6 border">
      <h4 class="font-italic" style="color: darkslategrey; text-align:left">Q3. From the RadioLab Podcast, the guest podcast artist is sharing his radio show called 99% invisible. The first piece is about sound design. What would you describe the role of the sound designer and how does it relate to this idea of theatre and performance?</h4>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Role of sound designer: Use audio cue to engage and enhance the investment of the audiences in the radio show. This is similar to theater and performance in a way that audiences could do just fine without the audio cue, but with audio cue, they have a much better experience due to feeling more entertained and engaged, thus reinforce their attendant to the show.</p>

      <h4 class="font-italic" style="color: darkslategrey; text-align:left">Q4. From the Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design article, what are the philosophical and visual differences between Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design and how might this also relate to this idea of theatre and gamification or aesthetic based event described in the Lev Article?</h4>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Skeuomorphism: The use of commonly recognized imagery to invoke the sense of familiarity; in short, emphasis on creating association between a person and something. Whereas, flat design places emphasis on readability, cleanliness and minimalism; in short, the aim is to be succinct in conveying the intended information.</p>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">The way this relates to gamification is that Skeuomorphosis could potentially be used to enhance users' experience, while "Flat Design" will helps conveying message more efficiently.</p>

Based on the Manovich reading, and following up on Q.1 ., As a group, find some images of 2 or more different examples of technologies that embodies for you the authors idea of how interfaces to early electronics or machine systems were designed in the past. Specifically look for examples from 1950's,60's, and 70's, (..not 1980's and 90's...). Explain why these are good examples. Then list 2 or more more images of examples of technology that embody the authors ideas of how interfaces are today. Again, explain why these are good examples. Please include images and text description for each example you are refering to. At least 2 images minimum per person from a group. For example a group of 3 should have 6 images.
