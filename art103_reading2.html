      <h2 class="font-italic" style="color: darkslategrey; text-align:left">Q1. What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea of art interventions.</h2>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Site specific: Art that was created for a specific location; the artist knows of the location's characteristic before creating the art; and the piece would lose it meaning if it were to be removed from the site.</p>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Art interventions: Art that interact with previously existing artwork, or art that intervene with a situation around the world with the intention of changing the status quo.</p>

      <h2 class="font-italic" style="color: darkslategrey; text-align:left">Q2. What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter De Maria and Banksy? include your thoughts on how their work might interpret ideas of site specificness and interventions</h2>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Similarity: Both artists have interactive arts that whose full meaning requires a feedbacks loop between audiences and the artwork.</p>
      <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Difference: Walter De Maria focuses on installation art that is site specific, his subject matters put emphasis on the viewers become aware of themselves.
        Bansky, on the other hand, often conduct performance art with emphasis on political and/or social commentary. His works also interact with audiences, but they are not site specific. </p>

        <h2 class="font-italic" style="color: darkslategrey; text-align:left">Q3. What are some of the most common creative tactics and requirements that all the signs must share to be relevant and effective? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home. </h2>
        <p style="color: black; text-align:left">The sign-makers must be aware of the symbolism of each type of signs, e.g. red sign is associated with command, whereas green signs would remind viewers of directional sign on the highway. The message must be concise since the interaction between the message and viewers would likely be short. In term of tactics--Signs should be installed in place that allows viewers to observe the sign; otherwise, signs would be forgotten.</p>

        <p style="color: black; text-align:left">Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas has a water show that takes place periodically at the hotel's fountain. I think this can be considered a site specific art since the performance takes place at a specific site; the work is also a performance art since the audiences need to turn up at a specific time to see the show.</p>

Despite this era of 'Shelter in Place', there must be some places you get out and frequent. In each of these places, what kind of signs or commentary could be produced for them. Specifically discuss as a group 1 sign idea per person in the group that could be placed in a space that would be an aknowledgement of a cultural undercurrent or upspoken truth. Document each persons answers in the group with the description of the sign and their location then prepare to share some of them in class.</h2>
        <p style="color: black; text-align:left">I have never been to Half Moon Bay in person, but when I looked up the site on Google Map I saw that there are graffitis being done on rocks and abandoned houses there. I think the activity is either a tag between teams, or an action similar to tourtist signing their name, messages, etc at famous tourist's attraction to remember their trip.</p>
