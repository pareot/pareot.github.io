The main theme of this piece came from the function random--a variety of rectangle shapes appear in the background in variety of gray adds depth to the piece. The wheel in front is created by many draw shape functions--the goal of this wheel is to add some stability to the work. The waves along the four borders were originally more wide and flowy, however while I still keep that version in the code, I decided this chaostic waves fit the overall aesthetic of the piece more.</p> -->

The objective was to create a custom function that can be called to draw an object instead of manually using many shape, and also to experiment with matrix. I constructed this clock mainly out of three custom functions--square, quad and circle; the rest are simple native processing function such as line, rotate, font. I'm happy with how the work turned out--I wanted to draw something concise, clean and visualially pleasing in contrast to the first code drawing DigiWheel (which relied on randomness for its appeal).</p> -->

The aesthetic I was going for was the old asian coin which consists of a round coin with a square hole; that and the phrase money don't grow on tree. I wanted to create a visual appealing work that is a utilize randomness to create an appealing visual. When I was making this piece, there was attention being paid to the rise of Asian hate crimes, being an international student living in the US, I embraced randomness and learnt to rise above it to live during this trying time.</p> -->
