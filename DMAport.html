Our group decided to build a project revolve around bee and I was in charge of making the schema to explain how the pieces are put together, as well as presenting extra information. Initially the design was to make a brochure, but I decided it would be interesting to make a pamphlet that include small facts about each piece. The more research I did on the bees, the more I was made aware of the negative impact we as humanity has on these critters (pesticide, abuse, etc). I included, at the bottom of the pamphlet, the illustration of the issue called "loss of pollinators" where bee's innate ability to navigate is damaged due to the impact of pesticide. I also mention helpful project that are being done to help bees increase in numbers.</p>

          <p style="color: black; text-align:center">This work was created using java and Processing, then produced into video through Premier and Encoder. The main theme of this piece came from the function random--a variety of rectangle shapes appear in the background in variety of gray adds depth to the piece. The wheel in front is created by many draw shape functions--the goal of this wheel is to add some stability to the work. The waves along the four borders were originally more wide and flowy, however while I still keep that version in the code, I decided this chaostic waves fit the overall aesthetic of the piece more.</p>

            <p style="color: black; text-align:center">This work was the second exercise I made during Art101. The objective was to create a custom function that can be called to draw an object instead of manually using many shape, and also to experiment with matrix. I constructed this clock mainly out of three custom functions--square, quad and circle; the rest are simple native processing function such as line, rotate, font. I'm happy with how the work turned out--I wanted to draw something concise, clean and visualially pleasing in contrast to the first code drawing DigiWheel (which relied on randomness for its appeal).</p>

I wanted to create a visual appealing work that is a utilize randomness to create an appealing visual.

The narrative of a sawblade cutting the moon in half is my literal take on the moon wanning; the piece also illustrate my feeling of the current trend of human discarding logic, following hatred and hurting one another like back in medival time where the sleep of reason produces monsters. The spark was made with text tool in After Effect--I picked up that trick from a tutorial and has been using it ever since.</p>
