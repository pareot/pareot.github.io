      <p style="color: black; text-align:center">This work was created using java and Processing, then produced into video through Premier and Encoder. The main theme of this piece came from the function random--a variety of rectangle shapes appear in the background in variety of gray adds depth to the piece. The wheel in front is created by many draw shape functions--the goal of this wheel is to add some stability to the work. The waves along the four borders were originally more wide and flowy, however while I still keep that version in the code, I decided this chaostic waves fit the overall aesthetic of the piece more.</p>

      <p style="color: black; text-align:center">This work was the second exercise I made during Art101. The objective was to create a custom function that can be called to draw an object instead of manually using many shape, and also to experiment with matrix. I constructed this clock mainly out of three custom functions--square, quad and circle; the rest are simple native processing function such as line, rotate, font. I'm happy with how the work turned out--I wanted to draw something concise, clean and visualially pleasing in contrast to the first code drawing DigiWheel (which relied on randomness for its appeal).</p>

      <p style="color: black; text-align:center">The second project in Art101. The goal was to create a class which is implemented with a algorithm--I chose recursion to draw a blooming tree. The aesthetic I was going for was the old asian coin which consists of a round coin with a square hole; that and the phrase money don't grow on tree. I wanted to create a visual appealing work that is a utilize randomness to create an appealing visual. When I was making this piece, there was attention being paid to the rise of Asian hate crimes, being an international student living in the US, I embraced randomness and learnt to rise above it to live during this trying time.</p>

My inspiration for this came from an illustration on a Western tales I read as a kid--the illustration depicted a man sitting on top of a tree, holding a big scissor, trying to cut the sun that was scorhing the land. The narrative of a sawblade cutting the moon in half is my literal take on the moon wanning; the piece also illustrate my feeling of the current trend of human discarding logic, following hatred and hurting one another like back in medival time where the sleep of reason produces monsters.</p>

I took inspiration from the pig in the game Don't Starve Together: pigs--who are very afraid of the dark--were happy to be basked light of the fire, thus started dancing at the campfire. To my mind, having pigs show happiness over such simple thing was such a good world building by the developer--I hope my work did them justice.</p>

This work is the second project in Art 102 where we build our own avatar.
